## Dear Reviewers

The instructions say " It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online."  

I accomplished this slightly differently by using knitr to write markdown.  Please open report-final.md .  It's the best of all worlds.  It renders online, the inline plots are included, and it reuses a technique I already knew about from the prior classes in the specialization.  Thank you for your patience.
