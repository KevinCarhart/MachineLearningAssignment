Dear reviewers, the instructions say " It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online."  

I accomplished this slightly differently by using knitr to write markdown.  Please open the file ending in .md.  It's the best of all worlds.  It renders online, the inline plots are included, and it reuses a technique I already knew about from the prior classes in the specialization.  Thank you for your patience.
